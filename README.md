# plume.js
A super lightweight toolkit for making Single Page Applications (SPA) in pure HTML/JS, based on WebComponents

# How to use it

First, you will need to import the plume.js file in your application's HTML file with a basic <script> tag.
This will allow you to use the WebComponents provided by Plume.js in your application.

## main-view and page-route

The ```<main-view>``` element represents, as it's name suggest, the main viewport of your application.
It acts as a router, meaning that it allows you to switch easily between the different pages or screens of your app.
You can define these pages or screens with the ```<page-route>``` element inside your ```<main-view>```.
